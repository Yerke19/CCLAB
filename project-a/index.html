                <p> Dr. Degelenovna at 04:29am in 2???

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p> Hypnosium Star's ancestars are ancient
                    starfishes on Earth. It's an advacned form of them, with the change of the habit and ability to
                    develop multiple modifications durings its short lifetime.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>This creature migrated to a new habitat - an air or sky, which is different from its ancestors
                    that
                    lived in water or earth. Because of that, the name of it is no longer a starfish, but a star as
                    it
                    is a medium stage between starfish and a star that is in the cosmos.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                The Everolving Star's main body is represented by the simpler form of the star that can change its
                shape, increasing sharpness in the second half of its lifetime. The modifications that appear inside
                of
                the star are additionally developed bodies. Each of these bodies have their own shapes, either
                bubbly,
                sharp or blossoming, replacing one another as the star’s lifetime goes on. They have distinguished
                pink-ish and blue-ish colors, signifying their relevance to the main body.

                Everolving Star is an evolutionary organism with its genetic background going back to the ancient
                starfishes on Earth. It has developed to the point where starfishes were able to ascend and make
                their
                appearance visible to anyone who looks up as it has not yet gone far into the cosmos. However, the
                lifetime of each star is extremely limited, happening most likely during the night time according to
                the
                surrounding darkness. The momentum to catch the stages of Everolving Star is less than 2 minutes.
                The
                name “Everolving” comes from two words “ever” and “evolving” due to the star’s continuous changes of
                shape during four remarkable stages, never stopping, forever losing previous features and adapting
                new
                modifications with every new appearance.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>The creature ascends
                and
                starts its development shortly after. You may interact with it by calling it to come to different
                places
                within its environment, but you cannot prevent it from the evolutionary process that will happen
                regardless of its position. Enjoy the beauty of it while it lasts!
