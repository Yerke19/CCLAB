                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p> Hypnosium Star's ancestars are ancient
                    starfishes on Earth. It's an advacned form of them, with the change of the habit and certain
                    features
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>This creature migrated to a new habitat - an air or sky, which is different from its ancestors that
                    lived in water or earth. Because of that, the name of it is no longer a starfish, but a star as it
                    is a medium stage between starfish and a star in the cosmos.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p> It has a unique shape of a star that may appear with different colors and a spinning arrow inside of
                    it.

                Hypnosium Star is an evolutionary organism with its genetic background going back to the ancient
                starfishes on Earth. It has developed to the point where starfishes were able to “fly” to the sky
                and make their appearance visible to anyone who looks up. The creature can divide into many versions
                of it, each having its own color. By having an inner arrow that reminds the hand of time constantly
                spinning, the star hypnotizes the one that looks on it for too long, hence the name. It multiplies with
                the aim to protect itself from external intervention as it starts to divide because
                of it happening; It dies shortly after multiplying.

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> The creature disappears
                from the sight of others shortly after being bothered, but it shows its beauty before fading away. Thus,
                it is up to each to decide whether they want to keep the star the way it is and make it last longer or
                reach to it to see a bright image but that will disappear shortly.
